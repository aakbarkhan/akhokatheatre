                <h2>About Akhoka</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group Akhoka is a collective of artists from different disciplines that aims to create critical physical performances and other allied activities of arts through a collaborative approach. We mainly like to address and question our socio, economic and political problems through performance. Akhoka is also interested in community-led and community-engaged performances by entering into different spaces of communities resulting from conflict, speedy urbanization, ills of social-economic and political institutions, displacement from man-made catastrophes, etc. We are also seeking an alternative and sustainable environment for practicing arts that affect the process and production. At the same time, we also want to consistently push the boundaries of our own practice and the boundaries of the field in which we are working by resonating, embodying, and questioning the contents to create critical performance praxis.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akhoka believes in the inclusive arts practice therefore we welcome you all irrespective of your discipline or background to join and helps us for fostering a better vision and praxis through the creative medium of performance and other allied activities of arts.</p>
